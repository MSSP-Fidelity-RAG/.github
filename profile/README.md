# MSSP x Fidelity RAG Chatbot

This repository hosts the **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Chatbot** project, developed in partnership with Fidelity through the MSSP (Masterâ€™s in Statistical Practice) program. The project is designed to offer users reliable, contextually relevant responses by retrieving information from predefined knowledge sources and generating answers based on the retrieved data.

## Project Concept

The RAG Chatbot leverages **LangChain** to build a retrieval-augmented generation pipeline that combines document retrieval with language generation, enabling the chatbot to provide well-informed, accurate responses. By retrieving relevant information from a structured knowledge base, the chatbot is capable of addressing user queries with precise and contextual answers. This approach ensures that the chatbot remains grounded in factual data, enhancing the reliability of its outputs.

The core concept focuses on:
- **Contextual and Relevant Responses**: Ensuring answers are grounded in the latest available knowledge sources.
- **Efficient Document Retrieval**: Retrieving pertinent information to support each response, leveraging embeddings for similarity-based matching.
- **Scalability**: Using LangChain allows the RAG Chatbot to integrate additional knowledge sources over time, making it adaptable to expanding datasets and knowledge bases.

This RAG Chatbot aims to bridge the gap between static knowledge retrieval and dynamic response generation, providing users with an interactive experience backed by robust data.
